## Overview

Nodit MCP Server simplifies how AI models and applications interact with blockchain ecosystems.  
Instead of handling complex node RPCs, raw event logs, or chain-specific data structures, developers can access normalized, multi-chain blockchain data in a format optimized for AI reasoning and decision-making.

With Nodit's MCP, you can:
- Build AI agents that query, analyze, and act on real-time blockchain data across EVM-compatible and non-EVM networks.
- Create Web3-integrated applications without requiring specialized blockchain development expertise.
- Leverage Nodit's reliable node infrastructure, Web3 Data APIs, and GraphQL indexing services through a unified access layer.

Supported networks include Ethereum, Base, Optimism, Arbitrum, Polygon, Aptos, Bitcoin, Dogecoin, TRON, XRPL, and more.

## How Nodit MCP Tools Work

Nodit MCP Server provides tools enabling AI agents to dynamically discover, understand, and interact with Nodit's Web3 APIs and data infrastructure. The tools minimize token consumption and maintain a lightweight context by modularizing API interactions into distinct steps:

- **List API Categories (`list_nodit_api_categories`)**  
  Retrieve a list of high-level API categories available.

- **List API Operations (`list_nodit_node_apis`, `list_nodit_data_apis`, `list_nodit_aptos_indexer_api_query_root`)**  
  Fetch available operations within a selected category (Node APIs, Data APIs, Aptos Indexer APIs).

- **Get API Specification (`get_nodit_api_spec`)**  
  Obtain detailed information for a specific API operation (parameters, request/response schema).

- **Call API (`call_nodit_api`,`call_nodit_aptos_indexer_api`)**  
  Execute an API call using the operationId and validated parameters.
  
Nodit MCP Server communicates using the standard JSON-RPC over stdio protocol, following the Model Context Protocol (MCP) conventions.
Currently, only stdio-based communication is supported for server-client interactions.


## Running evals

The evals package loads an mcp client that then runs the index.ts file, so there is no need to rebuild between tests. You can load environment variables by prefixing the npx command. Full documentation can be found [here](https://www.mcpevals.io/docs).

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-key  npx mcp-eval src/evals/evals.ts src/tools/data-apis.ts
```

## Features

The following are the key features and supported blockchain networks provided through Nodit MCP Server for AI agents and LLMs.  
For detailed API specifications and usage guidelines, please refer to the [Nodit Developer Documentation](https://developer.nodit.io/).

- **RPC Node & Node APIs**  
  Access blockchain node endpoints through Nodit's professionally operated infrastructure.  
  Supports real-time network queries, transaction submissions, smart contract interactions, and more.

- **Web3 Data APIs**  
  High-level APIs for accessing meticulously indexed blockchain data.  
  Includes processed datasets such as block and transaction details, token transfer histories, account-level transaction summaries, and asset movement details ‚Äî information that would be difficult to assemble directly through raw RPC calls.

- **GraphQL Indexer APIs (Aptos only)**  
  Query detailed Aptos blockchain activities through GraphQL endpoints.

- **Supported Networks**  
  - EVM-Compatible: Ethereum, Arbitrum, Avalanche, Base, Chiliz, Kaia, Optimism, Polygon
  - Non-EVM: Aptos, Bitcoin, Dogecoin, TRON, XRPL


## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- **Nodit API Key** (Sign up and get an API key at [Nodit Console](https://nodit.lambda256.io/))


## Running Local Nodit MCP Server

### Using npx (Recommended)

```bash
npx @noditlabs/nodit-mcp-server@latest
```

### Using local build

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/noditlabs/nodit-mcp-server.git

# Move into the project directory
cd nodit-mcp-server

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build the project
npm run build
```

Before starting, set your Nodit API key:

```bash
export NODIT_API_KEY=your-api-key
```

Then start the server:

```bash
node build/index.js
```

### Communicating with the Local Server

Once the Nodit MCP Server is running locally, you can communicate with it using **JSON-RPC over stdio**.  
Here‚Äôs how you can send a basic request to the server:

**Example: List available tools**

You can directly input the JSON-RPC payload:

```bash
{"method":"tools/list","params":{},"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1}
```

Or, you can pipe the request using the `echo` command:

```bash
echo '{"method":"tools/list","params":{},"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1}' | node build/index.js
```

**Example: Call a specific tool (list_nodit_api_categories)**

```bash
echo '{"method":"tools/call","params":{"name":"list_nodit_api_categories","arguments":{}},"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1}' | node build/index.js
```

## Integration 

### Connecting to Cursor IDE or Claude Desktop

Add the following configuration to your `.cursor/mcp.json` or `claude_desktop_config.json`:

- **Cursor**
  - MacOS: `~/.cursor/mcp.json`
  - Windows: `C:\Users\<Username>\.cursor\mcp.json`

- **Claude Desktop**
  - MacOS: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
  - Windows: `C:\Users\<Username>\AppData\Roaming\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "nodit": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["@noditlabs/nodit-mcp-server@latest"],
      "env": {
        "NODIT_API_KEY": "****"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
> üîî **Important**  
> Replace `****` with your actual Nodit API key.  
> If the API key is not configured properly, API requests will fail due to authentication errors.

### Connecting to Claude CLI

You can also use Nodit MCP Server directly with Claude CLI for a quick setup.

Add Nodit MCP Server with the following commands:

```bash
# Add the Nodit MCP server
claude mcp add nodit-mcp-server npx @noditlabs/nodit-mcp-server

# Set API Key
export NODIT_API_KEY=your-api-key

# Start Claude with the Nodit MCP server enabled
claude
```

## Scope & Limitations

Nodit MCP Server provides structured context to help LLM-based agents utilize Nodit's APIs effectively.  
Its responsibilities include:

- Structuring Nodit APIs (Node APIs, Web3 Data APIs) in an LLM-consumable format.
- Exposing endpoint details, input/output schemas, sample responses, and error handling guidelines.

However, the following are **outside the MCP's control**:

- API selection may vary depending on the LLM version (e.g., GPT-4, Claude 3), prompt engineering, or agent design.
- Interpretation of API responses or errors depends on the consuming LLM's reasoning capabilities.

Nodit MCP Server focuses on delivering accurate and structured API context,  
but does **not guarantee** the final reasoning outcomes or behavior of external LLMs.
